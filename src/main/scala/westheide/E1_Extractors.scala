      * EXTRACTORS
      */

    // In its most widely applied form, an extractor has the opposite role of a constructor: While the latter
    // creates an object from a given list of parameters, an extractor extracts the parameters from which an
    // object passed to it was created.
    // Case classes are special because Scala automatically creates a companion object for them: a singleton
    // object that contains not only an apply method for creating new instances of the case class, but also an
    // unapply method â€“ the method that needs to be implemented by an object in order for it to be an extractor.

    case class User(firstName: String, lastName: String, score: Int)
    def advance(xs: List[User]) = xs match {
      case User(_, _, score1) :: User(_, _, score2) :: _ => score1 - score2
      case _ => 0
    }


    // We want to implement extractors for the FreeUser and PremiumUser classes in respective companion objects,
    // just as Scala would have done were these case classes.
    trait User1 {
      def name: String
    }
    class FreeUser(val name: String) extends User1
    class PremiumUser(val name: String) extends User1

    object FreeUser {
      def unapply(user: FreeUser): Option[String] = Some(user.name)
    }
    object PremiumUser {
      def unapply(user: PremiumUser): Option[String] = Some(user.name)
    }

    println(FreeUser.unapply(new FreeUser("Daniel")))
    // RESULT: Some(Daniel)

    // If the result of calling unapply is Some[T], this means that the pattern matches, and the extracted value
    // is bound to the variable declared in the pattern. If it is None, this means that the pattern doesnâ€™t
    // match and the next case statement is tested.

    val user: User1 = new PremiumUser("Daniel")
    user match {
      case FreeUser(name) => "Hello" + name
      case PremiumUser(name) => "Welcome back, dear " + name
    }

    // The two extractors never return None! The example shows that this makes more sense than it might seem at first.
    // If you have an object that could be of some type or another, you can check its type and destructure it at the
    // same time. In the example, the FreeUser pattern will not match bevause it expects an object of a different type
    // than we pass it. Since it wants an object of type FreeUser, not one of type PremiumUser, this extractor is never
    // even called.

      * EXTRACTING SEVERAL VALUES
